    <h1>AOA! This is a Git/ GitHub Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to GitHub</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
       This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own repository and
       learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
       In this quickstart guide, you will:
       <ul>
           <li>Create and use a repository</li>
           <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
           <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
       </ul>    
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a repository</h2>
    <p>A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders
         and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. To create 
        a repository, following are the steps you need to follow</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.</li>
            <img src="images\repo-create.png" alt="Create Repo">
            <li>In the Repository name box, enter hello-world.</li>
            <li>In the Description box, write a short description.</li>
            <li>Select Add a README file(optional)</li>
            <li>Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.</li>
            <li>Click Create repository.</li>
            <img id = "createRepo" src="images\hello-world-repo.png" alt="blah blah blah">
        </ol>

    <h2>Adding and pushing files</h2>
    <p>When you create a repository there are some options to add files in that repository. To create files locally and push them to github follow these steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the following (first 2) commands and paste it in the command line (Navigate to the folder first)</li>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images\copy.png" alt="">
        <li>To check the status use "git status"</li>
        <img style="width: 100%; " src="images\gitStatus.png" alt="">
        <li>After that add the desired files by using "git add file-name" </li>
        <li>Commit the changes by typing "git commit -m "commit_title" - "commit_description" "</li>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images\commit.png" alt="">
        <li>Finally push the files to github by typing "git push"</li>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images\push.png" alt="">
    </ol>

    <h2>Making and committing changes</h2>
    <p>
        You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.
         Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
          Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a File to make changes</li>
        <li>Click the pen icon to edit the file.</li>
        <li>In the editor, Make the desired changes.</li>
        <li>In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
        <li>Click Commit changes.</li>
        <img id = "firstcommit" src="images\first-commit.png" alt="">
    </ol>
    <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>
        Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time. <br>
        By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. 
        You can create additional branches off of main in your repository. 
        You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. 
        This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. 
        The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. 
        You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main. <br>
        When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. 
        If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates. <br>
        
        
        
    </p>
    This diagram shows:
    <ul>
        <li>The main branch</li>
        <li>A new branch called feature</li>
        <li>The journey that feature takes before it's merged into main</li>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images\branching.png" alt="">
    </ul>
    <h2>Create a branch</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the Code tab of your repository.</li>
        <li>Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says main.</li>
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="images\branch-selection-dropdown.png" alt="">
        <li>Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box.</li>
        <li>Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.</li>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="images\new-branch.png" alt="">
    </ol>
    <p>Now you have two branches, main and readme-edits. 
        Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.</p>
