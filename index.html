    <h1>AOA! This is a Git/ GitHub Tutorial</h1>
    <h3>Introduction to GitHub</h3>
    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
       This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own repository and
       learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
       In this quickstart guide, you will:
       <ul>
           <li>Create and use a repository</li>
           <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
           <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
       </ul>    
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a repository</h2>
    <p>A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders
         and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. To create 
        a repository, following are the steps you need to follow</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.</li>
            <img src="images\repo-create.png" alt="Create Repo">
            <li>In the Repository name box, enter hello-world.</li>
            <li>In the Description box, write a short description.</li>
            <li>Select Add a README file(optional)</li>
            <li>Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.</li>
            <li>Click Create repository.</li>
            <img id = "createRepo" src="images\hello-world-repo.png" alt="blah blah blah">
        </ol>
    <h2>Making and committing changes</h2>
    <p>
        You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.
         Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
          Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a File to make changes</li>
        <li>Click the pen icon to edit the file.</li>
        <li>In the editor, Make the desired changes.</li>
        <li>In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
        <li>Click Commit changes.</li>
        <img id = "firstcommit" src="images\first-commit.png" alt="">
    </ol>
